## Count number of trailing zeros in Binary representation of a number using Bitset
Given a number. The task is to count the number of Trailing Zero in Binary representation of a number using bitset.

### Examples :

```
Input : N = 16
Output : 4
Binary representation of N is 1000. Therefore,
number of zeroes at the end is 3.

Input : N = 8
Output : 3
```
